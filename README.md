# AdvUI Sidescroller
**Andrea Alesani - M2 EIT HCID
Nicolò Sonnino - M2 EIT HCID**

The project will consist of a side-scrolling video game. The game will have the following features:

- The player will choose the character and the map they want to play (menu)
- The game will include a variety of enemies, depending on the level, with different attacks
- The character will have both melee (and shooting ?) weapons and a shield to protect itself
- The player will have both life points and stamina that will be visible at the top left corner of the screen: blocking will decrease the stamina and receiving damage from enemies will decrease the life points
- When reaching 0 life points, a “game over” menu will appear, presenting different options such as “restart”, “change level”, and “quit”
- A music player will be visible in the top right corner to choose the preferred soundtrack for the game
- The background will move along with the player (side scrolling)
